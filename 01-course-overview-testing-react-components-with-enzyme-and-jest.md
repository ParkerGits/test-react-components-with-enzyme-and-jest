# Course Overview: Testing React Components with Enzyme and Jest

**[ðŸ“¹ Video](https://egghead.io/lessons/react-course-overview-testing-react-components-with-enzyme-and-jest)**

## The Goal
In React, we want our components to be
- Composable
- Reusable
- Accessible
- Intuitive
- Predictable

In this course, we will learn how to make components that manifest the above characteristics.

## Enzyme
Throughout the course, we'll be using Enzyme.

**Enzyme allows us to test both how our components work and how users will interact with them.**

## What you can expect
Throughout this course, you will learn about
- Enzyme initial setup
- Working with Redux-connected components
- Enzyme configuration for specific versions of React
- Accepted selectors
- Rendering methods
- Working with React lifecycles
- Component state
- Component props
- Jest snapshots to
  - Guarantee the layout of component elements
  - Replicate user interaction
  - Test class methods

We will introduce these concepts through the testing of both a basic React form that sends an AJAX request on submit, and a Redux-connected component.
